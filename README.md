# Blueprint-Overdrive

Hey! Our team of 3 (with me being the person who submits) will spend this school year working on a robot for RoboCup Junior's Rescue Line challenge. Our competition will take place in April, and our goal is to secure first place, allowing us to compete internationally at the RCJ 2026 event in South Korea.

We want to participate in Blueprint to secure funding for some of the components that go into making this robot, including motors, a Jetson Nano, batteries, and other external supplies.

Here's a rough timeline for us so far:
**August:** Planning Stage
**September–October:** 3D Modeling
**October–December:** Building
**January–April:** Coding and Testing
