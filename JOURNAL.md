## 10/6/2025 - 3D modeled Greartisan 12V DC motors based off of online spec  

Created baseplate for the robot and added screw holes for motors
Motor mounts are connected directly to 4 pillars on the corners of the baseplate
Motor mounts loop around the front and the left and right sides of the motor, leaving the top uncovered to place the motor into position

## 10/24/2025 7 PM - Developed front panel system for robot CAD  

Made the front panels and stuck a camera right in the middle.
Slid the distance sensors between two plates to keep them steady.
Screwed those plates onto the baseplate and added another frame on top for extra stability, feels way more secure now.

We're really unsure about the ToF sensors right now, but we'll keep what we have.

## 10/24/2025 8:25 PM - Developed additional CAD for electronics  


Threw in a voltage checker, distance sensors, the Jetson Orin Nano, an Arduino Nano screw terminal, and a buck converter (that grey box-looking thing).
Added a back plate that holds the distance sensors and voltage checkers on the left side, plus another frame on top of the baseplate to use space more efficiently.

Dropped in an Arduino Nano screw terminal at the front. Added two batteries, one on each side, to keep the weight balanced.

## 10/24/2025 8:26 PM - Developed initial front bumper prototype  

Started working on the front bumper and figured out where to mount the camera for line tracing.
Built an arm-claw system and tested a bunch of versions until one finally worked.

The issue we're having here is that we want to keep the robot length under 25cm, but the front bumper makes it reach 24cm. However, removing it would not allow us to have LEDs on our robot. ![Screenshot 2025-10-24 at 8.26.03 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTMzNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--188550c333b4222e76564de5a1804e0a8d55e6de/Screenshot%202025-10-24%20at%208.26.03%E2%80%AFPM.png)
  

## 10/24/2025 8:27 PM - Started developing a complex arm/claw system  

Created arm-claw system, tested multiple iterations until a working version was established
First set out on creating an arm design.

We are aware that this will need additional improvement.

First arm design:

## 10/24/2025 8:28 PM - Continued to develop arm system for the robot  

Two MG90s microservos added to control the claws
1 TD 8120mg servo with 20 kg torque for moving the entire arm and claw
This arm design was too heavy, however.
Also, it had to be printed in two parts, which isn’t efficient, thus was changed

## 10/25/2025 11:19 AM - Now that the arm is mostly complete, working on claw design  

We originally tried more flat claw designs, but after testing, this did not work because of key flaws. It was too complex and didn't secure the ball well, especially since the microservos aren't that strong. Soon, we'll try changing and iterating our design.![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 11.19.47 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTQ1OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4d92024d300258677def1d46b1da9c8f62271960/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%2011.19.47%E2%80%AFAM.png)

  

## 10/25/2025 11:21 AM - Partially finalizing the claw and arm (improvements)  

Afterward, a lot of experimentation was done to ensure the claw would grab the ball securely while minimizing weight. We had to iterate many times (and print many times). Our design is below:![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 11.20.43 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTQ2MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--120e5dd3f36bf1cd6f333e98f7653be0e547b465/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%2011.20.43%E2%80%AFAM.png)

We stayed up overnight since our printer kept failing with our support settings for the final claw print, since it was not flat anymore. After playing around with the seetings, tree supports worked well, and the claw worked very well with a ball. Key features include:
Spherical design, allowing it to fit better around the ball
Thinner claw (roughly 1-2 mm thick, allowing for it to be solid without being bulky)
![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 11.21.39 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTQ2MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--37377ba20338155626898e5a2111faccbb9aef3d/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%2011.21.39%E2%80%AFAM.png)



  

## 10/25/2025 11:32 AM - Fixed a problem with claw/arm to adapt it to robot design  

The new arm/claw was lightweight, but additional changes had to be made when adding it to our robot, as when the claw is rotated upward/downward, the buck boost converter (represented as a blue box) as well as the linetracing camera (orange) got in the way

![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 11.31.35 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTQ2MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1ee5ef601371c984dabf96189889e4de6a1df96e/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%2011.31.35%E2%80%AFAM.png)

To get around this, the arm had to bend 90 degrees to remain centered. This is important because to find victims, we use the wide angle camera (centered and mounted on our front plate). This means that when the robot has reached the ball, the ball should be right in front of the camera at the center.
  

## 10/25/2025 4 PM - Finalized the initial working prototype of robot CAD  

We created a third platform, a ramp structure on the back half of the robot, for storing victims (represented as metal balls in RCJ).
The ramp structure makes it so that balls will roll toward the bottom naturally, and a system will be created with the microservo at the back of the third platform for releasing the victims
Moreover, we created a battery mount that also functions as a mount for the distance sensors
A new platform (the grey one to the left of the camera) on top of the frame for attaching the buck boost converters is there as well.![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 4.54.27 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTU0NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--dc3354de641f71118602ec191fba1ab265bd2db6/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%204.54.27%E2%80%AFPM.png)

We iterated the 3rd platform and the battery mounts numerous times to get to this version.

  

## 10/25/2025 11 PM - Developed 3rd platform system (testing still needed)  

Added a microservo in the back of the third platform for controlling which section on the third platform is released
(in RCJ rescue line, silver balls representing live victims have to be released in one area, while black balls representing dead victims have to be released in another)
![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 11.34.37 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYxMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--32c54d42d9f3368507360a54469a61c84b2013ea/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%2011.34.37%E2%80%AFPM.png)

A “wing” was created to be attached to the microservo
This wing would rotate, and should allow one sides balls to roll off the ramp, while the others stays on the platform
However, when the wing tilts downward to one side, it’s possible for the balls on the other side to roll out too if they’re on the far left/right sides of the third platform
Lastly, bumps were added to the wings so that when one side tilts downward, and the other side tilts upward, the wings go up as well, preventing the balls on the far sides from slipping through
