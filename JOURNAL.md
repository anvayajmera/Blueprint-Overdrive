## 10/6/2025 - 3D modeled Greartisan 12V DC motors based off of online spec  

Created baseplate for the robot and added screw holes for motors
Motor mounts are connected directly to 4 pillars on the corners of the baseplate
Motor mounts loop around the front and the left and right sides of the motor, leaving the top uncovered to place the motor into position

## 10/24/2025 7 PM - Developed front panel system for robot CAD  

Made the front panels and stuck a camera right in the middle.
Slid the distance sensors between two plates to keep them steady.
Screwed those plates onto the baseplate and added another frame on top for extra stability, feels way more secure now.

We're really unsure about the ToF sensors right now, but we'll keep what we have.

## 10/24/2025 8:25 PM - Developed additional CAD for electronics  


Threw in a voltage checker, distance sensors, the Jetson Orin Nano, an Arduino Nano screw terminal, and a buck converter (that grey box-looking thing).
Added a back plate that holds the distance sensors and voltage checkers on the left side, plus another frame on top of the baseplate to use space more efficiently.

Dropped in an Arduino Nano screw terminal at the front. Added two batteries, one on each side, to keep the weight balanced.

## 10/24/2025 8:26 PM - Developed initial front bumper prototype  

Started working on the front bumper and figured out where to mount the camera for line tracing.
Built an arm-claw system and tested a bunch of versions until one finally worked.

The issue we're having here is that we want to keep the robot length under 25cm, but the front bumper makes it reach 24cm. However, removing it would not allow us to have LEDs on our robot. ![Screenshot 2025-10-24 at 8.26.03 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTMzNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--188550c333b4222e76564de5a1804e0a8d55e6de/Screenshot%202025-10-24%20at%208.26.03%E2%80%AFPM.png)
  

## 10/24/2025 8:27 PM - Started developing a complex arm/claw system  

Created arm-claw system, tested multiple iterations until a working version was established
First set out on creating an arm design.

We are aware that this will need additional improvement.

First arm design:

## 10/24/2025 8:28 PM - Continued to develop arm system for the robot  

Two MG90s microservos added to control the claws
1 TD 8120mg servo with 20 kg torque for moving the entire arm and claw
This arm design was too heavy, however.
Also, it had to be printed in two parts, which isn’t efficient, thus was changed
![Screenshot 2025-10-24 at 8.28.05 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTMzNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ac6db1a956d75755987a82fc505a598d4832908a/Screenshot%202025-10-24%20at%208.28.05%E2%80%AFPM.png)
  

## 10/25/2025 11:19 AM - Now that the arm is mostly complete, working on claw design  

We originally tried more flat claw designs, but after testing, this did not work because of key flaws. It was too complex and didn't secure the ball well, especially since the microservos aren't that strong. Soon, we'll try changing and iterating our design.![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 11.19.47 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTQ1OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4d92024d300258677def1d46b1da9c8f62271960/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%2011.19.47%E2%80%AFAM.png)

  

## 10/25/2025 11:21 AM - Partially finalizing the claw and arm (improvements)  

Afterward, a lot of experimentation was done to ensure the claw would grab the ball securely while minimizing weight. We had to iterate many times (and print many times). Our design is below:![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 11.20.43 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTQ2MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--120e5dd3f36bf1cd6f333e98f7653be0e547b465/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%2011.20.43%E2%80%AFAM.png)

We stayed up overnight since our printer kept failing with our support settings for the final claw print, since it was not flat anymore. After playing around with the seetings, tree supports worked well, and the claw worked very well with a ball. Key features include:
Spherical design, allowing it to fit better around the ball
Thinner claw (roughly 1-2 mm thick, allowing for it to be solid without being bulky)
![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 11.21.39 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTQ2MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--37377ba20338155626898e5a2111faccbb9aef3d/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%2011.21.39%E2%80%AFAM.png)



  

## 10/25/2025 11:32 AM - Fixed a problem with claw/arm to adapt it to robot design  

The new arm/claw was lightweight, but additional changes had to be made when adding it to our robot, as when the claw is rotated upward/downward, the buck boost converter (represented as a blue box) as well as the linetracing camera (orange) got in the way

![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 11.31.35 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTQ2MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1ee5ef601371c984dabf96189889e4de6a1df96e/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%2011.31.35%E2%80%AFAM.png)

To get around this, the arm had to bend 90 degrees to remain centered. This is important because to find victims, we use the wide angle camera (centered and mounted on our front plate). This means that when the robot has reached the ball, the ball should be right in front of the camera at the center.
  

## 10/25/2025 4 PM - Finalized the initial working prototype of robot CAD  

We created a third platform, a ramp structure on the back half of the robot, for storing victims (represented as metal balls in RCJ).
The ramp structure makes it so that balls will roll toward the bottom naturally, and a system will be created with the microservo at the back of the third platform for releasing the victims
Moreover, we created a battery mount that also functions as a mount for the distance sensors
A new platform (the grey one to the left of the camera) on top of the frame for attaching the buck boost converters is there as well.![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 4.54.27 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTU0NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--dc3354de641f71118602ec191fba1ab265bd2db6/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%204.54.27%E2%80%AFPM.png)

We iterated the 3rd platform and the battery mounts numerous times to get to this version.

  

## 10/25/2025 11 PM - Developed 3rd platform system (testing still needed)  

Added a microservo in the back of the third platform for controlling which section on the third platform is released
(in RCJ rescue line, silver balls representing live victims have to be released in one area, while black balls representing dead victims have to be released in another)
![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 11.34.37 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYxMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--32c54d42d9f3368507360a54469a61c84b2013ea/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%2011.34.37%E2%80%AFPM.png)

A “wing” was created to be attached to the microservo
This wing would rotate, and should allow one sides balls to roll off the ramp, while the others stays on the platform
However, when the wing tilts downward to one side, it’s possible for the balls on the other side to roll out too if they’re on the far left/right sides of the third platform
Lastly, bumps were added to the wings so that when one side tilts downward, and the other side tilts upward, the wings go up as well, preventing the balls on the far sides from slipping through

## 11/9/2025 11:27 AM - 3D printed and tested claw iterations  

I started to 3D print and test claw iterations (around 4). I needed to print it multiple times to tweak minor things, but this built version will likely be our final one (we might add stuff later tho)!

![Screenshot 2025-11-09 at 10.35.29 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTc2OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--de00eea9ed80e21c43df7febfa1ecd269e399ec8/Screenshot%202025-11-09%20at%2010.35.29%E2%80%AFAM.png)
  

## 11/9/2025 11:30 AM - Printed all parts and took off supports  

(FYI I'm logging the time spent to adjust the 3d printer and take off supports)
![Screenshot 2025-11-09 at 10.37.31 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTc3MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e9be18874e349d455715fb0ebc9e10090b398fa6/Screenshot%202025-11-09%20at%2010.37.31%E2%80%AFAM.png)

We printed ALL the parts for the robot, with many having a great amount of tree supports that needed to be removed using flush cutters. Also, many times, the print ended up being unsuccessful due to starting the print too fast, print sticking off, or even some form of random error.  

## 11/9/2025 11:33 AM - Planned out what parts would go to what battery  

Most of this time was spent ideating and chatting between teamates. Since we have 2 4200mah LiPo batteries, we needed to find a good split between parts to make sure both run out at around the same time period. Note that one battery is solely powering the Jetson Orin Nano. This is because we realized that other power consuming parts, like the LED, can be attached to the USB port of the Jetson Orin Nano.

## 11/9/2025 11:35 AM - Soldered wires onto motors   

I soldered wires onto each of the motors since it was clear that it would be too hard to do once the motors are already on the robot. I wanted to attach heatshrink to the connection ports of the motors, but when i tried to do this, the heatstrink would just stick off of the ports and not work. Either way, I'm hoping that this has a good enough connection. 




![Screenshot 2025-11-09 at 11.33.50 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTc3NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--920cce9001b44265c6371627c442402bfb08d386/Screenshot%202025-11-09%20at%2011.33.50%E2%80%AFAM.png)


  

## 11/9/2025 11:41 AM - Iterated complete main connection circuit of the robot  

I spent a lot of time getting this circuit to be perfect since it was the primary electronic component of our robot. If something goes wrong here, the entire robot will be affected. Originally, I made the mistake of not knowing that there was a type of switch that only turns on when you hold it, and flips back off once you release it. Unfortunately, because of this, I had to restart everything with the proper switch. Other things I had to work on here was making good solder connections, putting heatshrink over every connection, looking at what wire lengths were the most optimal, and testing voltage of each part along the way. Another major event was that one of the buck boost converters stopped displaying voltage, which made me very confused. After over an hour of trying to figure out what happened, I realized the internal wire connection it came with was really, REALLY, bad. I fixed it, though, and the wiring works now!


![Screenshot 2025-11-09 at 11.37.36 AM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTc4MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--46a00294c9f500694adb9bc52176e4b98812041f/Screenshot%202025-11-09%20at%2011.37.36%E2%80%AFAM.png)
  

## 11/9/2025 11:50 AM - Finalized Display Port wire (sob)  

This one was a nightmare. So, we knew that we were NOT going to rely on something like VNC Viewer on competition day (if ykyk) and the clear path to take was the old keyboard and mouse route. However, once the robot was built, these ports would be completely inaccessible, meaning we needed extender wires attached to the ports beforehand that come out to an external point of the robot that we could access. Originally, I thought that the Jetson Orin Nano was going to use an HDMI port. But, after taking a closer look, it was a Display Port. The problem with this was that when I ended up buying an extender for this, it was WAY too thick and did not fit. I even cut one open to see if removing the plastic shell could help (it did not). So, I had to buy 6 different versions before coming across a slim fit version seen in the picture.. A great learning experience, but it was very annoying.
